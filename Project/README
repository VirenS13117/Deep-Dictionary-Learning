Image Compression using Deep Dictionary Learning
for 4:1 compression
1. Training Data : CIFAR 10 patches of size 8X8
2. Testing Data : sample image patches like lena, barbara etc
3. main.m contains calls to following methods for image compression:
	a. KSVD 
	b. DDL 2 layers 
	c. DDL 3 layers
	c. Stacked autoeoncoder 
	d. Wavelet Compression
	e. DCT
Each call is kept in different sections
4. All sections are commented for now, to run any compression please uncomment the corresponding section
4. I have already saved trained dictionaries on CIFAR10 and autoencoder weights in Data folder:
	a. DDL_16_16.mat : trained Deep dictionary 2 levels with atoms(16,16)
	b. DDL_32_16.mat : trained Deep dictionary 2 levels with atoms(32,16)
	c. DDL_48_32_16.mat : trained Deep dictionary 3 levels with atoms(48,32,16)
	d. KSVD_single_layer.mat : KSVD dictionary(16 atoms)
	e. SAE_64_32_16.mat : trained SAE on CIFAR 10 with layers (32,16)
5. main.m makes use of these pre trained dictionaries and SAE to run test on sample images
6. We can see reconstructed images as output
7. To run wavelet compression please add folders and subfolders of Wavelab850 in MATLAB project
8. To run KSVD please add folders and subfolders of KSVD in MATLAB project
9. To see the actual training of dictionaries and stacked autoencoder please run main_train.m by uncommenting corresponding sections
10. for 8:1 compression use following saved trained dictionaries in main.m:
	a. DDL_16_08.mat : deep dictionary 2 levels with atoms(16,8)
	b. DDL_08_08.mat : deep dictionary 2 levels with atoms(8,8)
	c. DDL_32_16_08.mat : deep dictionary 3 levels with atoms(32,16,8)
